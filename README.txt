-->E_in_thermalization--> E vs t in thermalization evolution.
For t=5 fluctuations in energy are up to 10% of the value of the mean energy.
As T increase, thermalization is easier. Nevertheless, fluctuations are higher.
Initial condition with max energy si=1 for all i.
-------THINGS TO DO---------------------------
-->IMPROVE REJECTION STEP

-->COMPUTE TIME
-->COMPUTE AVERAGES, DO THEY HAVE SENSEÂ¿?
-->COMPUTE ERRORS
--------------------THINGS ALREADY DONE----------------------
-->PUT BODY OF THERMALIZATION AS A FUNCTION-->DONE
